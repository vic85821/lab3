question:A
	you can compile with Makefile
	just enter "make" to compile file
question:B
    size:
	n=1000
		sort(): 0 seconds
		v1/v2 are different.
		insertion_sort(): 0.01 seconds
		v1/v2 are the same.

	n=10000
		sort(): 0 seconds
		v1/v2 are different.
		insertion_sort(): 1.31 seconds
		v1/v2 are the same.

	n=100000
		sort(): 0.05 seconds
		v1/v2 are different.
		insertion_sort(): 128.19 seconds
		v1/v2 are the same.

	n=1000000
		sort(): 0.5 seconds
		v1/v2 are different.
		insertion_sort(): 12824 seconds
		v1/v2 are the same.


	sort using quicksort,it takes n*logn 
	insert_sort using insert sort,it takes n^2
	because their units are diffetent,we have to divid by"CLOCKS_PER_SEC" to contrast
